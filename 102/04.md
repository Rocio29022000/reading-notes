### Notes
CSS is a rule-based language. Defining the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elemens or groups of elements on your web page.
> Example:   
h1 {  
  color: red;  
  font-size: 5em;  
}  
"This will set all the h1 headings to Red and font size 5em."

For the above example:
- Opens up with a _**selector**_, which selects an HTML element, in this case biggest headings (h1).
- Then opens curly braces { }.
- Inside these braces we have _**declarations**_ which come in pairs.
    - _**Property**_: in this case color.
    - _**Value**_: in this case red.

You can Add CSS externally, internally or inline. (Check link for more info: [How to Add CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp)).
- External: link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"
- Internal: add it in a style element inside the head section.
- Inline: add it as a style attribute to the relevant element.



If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used.
