### Wireframe and Design
#### An introductioin to wireframing
What is a wireframe?  
Plan of the information hierarchy of the desgn for a website, app, or product.  
Based on user research  
Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.  

[9 examples of web & app wireframe](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/website-app-wireframe-examples/)  

Here are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:  

- Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
- Sketch > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

This becomes more significant based on the importance of the visual design, as a backend admin interface could do with going straight from sketch to code, whereas a if the business value & resources are high then it is worth spending the time on a high-definition wireframe and going through cycles of testing.

Online wireframe tools:
- [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/): UXPin has a wide range of functionalities, but one of the best ones is how it facilitates building responsive, clickable prototypes directly in your browser.
- [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/): InVision allows you to get feedback straight from your team and users through clickable mock-ups of your site design. It’s completely free too!
- [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/): Wireframe.cc provides you with the technology to create wireframes really quickly within your browser, the online version of pen and paper.
- [UsabilityHub](https://usabilityhub.com/): To preference test screens and collect qualitative feedback.
- [Prott](https://prottapp.com/features/): To test and check understanding of the basic user flow. With this tool, you can simply photograph and upload your hand-sketched wireframes, and then connect them to user button overlays.

### Steps to make a wireframe
1. Do your Research:   
        Understand your audience. 
                User research.  
                Detailing requirements.  
                Creating user personas.  
                Defining use cases.  
                Competition & industry research.  
        Note: also research outside of your domain when designing a new feature.
2. Prepare your research for reference:  
        Keep all the research noted somewhere have a common notepad for each project, OneNote, GitHub...
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out:  
        Important to have a concept of where your users will be coming from and where you need them to end up.
4. Draft, don't draw. Sketch, dont illustrate  
        Good idea is to use a thick marker pen (to prevent you from getting into detail). *
5. Add some detail and get testing:  
    Think about  
            Usability conventions, such as putting the navigation at the top next to your logo, having a search box on the top right, and so on  
            Simple, instructional wording for i.e. calls-to-action  
            Trust-building elements: What do you need to build trust in your customers and where would be the best place to put these elements?  
            Tooltips to indicate any functionality that could be included in a prototype transition
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes  
        You can use tools like Proto.io, Adobe XD and Framer. Most well known is Sketch and Figma.

"*" Important questions to ask yourself
* How can you organise the content to support your users’ goals?
* Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
* What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
* Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?

### How to make your wireframe good: Three key principles
1. Maintain clarity
2. Gain user confidence (put uttons where users expects them to be, no surprises!)
3. Simplicity is key
