### Notes

### Control Flow
The *control flow* is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

### Functions
In JavaScript we use the function keyword for this followed by the name of the new function. Then the list of parameters in parentheses and then a block of expressions in curly braces. This is the body of the function.
>Ex:  
function show() {  
  console.log('Hello World');  
}  
console.log('before');  
show();  
console.log('after');  

You can call a function multiple times.  

You can alo provide *parameters*.  
>Ex:  
function show(name) {  
  console.log('Hello ', name);  
}  
show('Foo');  
show('Bar');  
show('Zorg');  

>The output will be:  
Hello Foo  
Hello Bar  
Hello Zorg  

In the function declaration we wrote that we are going to accept a single value and we want it to be assigned to the name variable. Then, we called the function and passed a value to it. In every call we passed a different value.

Inside the function the name variable holds the current value.
