## Notes
You can either embed the JavaScript code directly inside the HTML file, or you can put a line in the HTML file that will include the external JavaScript file. In most cases the latter is recommended. We use "script" (inside <>) as opening and "/script" as closing tag, and between we ride the javascript code.
>Ex:  
alert("Hello World");

### Alert
alert("") will pop-up an alert on the browser with whatever text you place inside.
>Ex:  
document.write(" (h1) Hello World(/h1)*");  
*The () are not actual brackets but used instead of the actual symbol. 

### document.write
The document.write() method writes directly to an open (HTML) document stream.
**Warning:**
The document.write() method deletes all existing HTML when used on a loaded document.
ex:  
document.write(h1)Hello World (/h1)  
this will embed the html after  

### console.log
Print out debugging information.
Most of the web browsers provide what is called a "JavaScript console". It is an additional window which is normally not visible, where the browser can print out warnings and errors generated by the execution of the JavaScript code. (E.g. if there is a syntax error in the code.) The developer can also print information to this console using the console.log() call.  
To open it right click and select "inspect"
>Ex:  
console.log("Hello World");

### prompt
It will show a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in. When the user presses OK, the value in the text box will be returned by the prompt() function. Then, in this example we use the document.write method to update the html with the text.
>Ex:  
var name = prompt("Your name:", "");  
document.write("Hello ", name);

### confirm
It allows the developer to ask a Yes/No question. Calling the confirm() function will show a pop-up window with the provided texts and with two buttons. If the user presses OK the confirm() function will return true, if the user presses cancel or hits the ESC key, the function will return false.

>Ex:  
if (confirm("Shall I print Hello World?")) {
    document.write("Hello World");
} else {
    document.write("OK, I won't print it.");
}


### Variables
Variables are Containers for Storing Data.  
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

- Automatically (when undeclared variables are first used)
- Using: var (Outdated: **Do not use**)
- Using: let
- Using: const (declares a constant variable, they cannot be changed)  
#### When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables
2. Always use const if the value should not be changed
3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)
4. Only use let if you can't use const
5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

Variables are like a box (stores a value), they are used in expressions.

All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names called **identifiers**.  
_**Careful!**_ Variable names are case sensitive.

### The assignment operator
In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.  
The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

### Data types
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".
In programming, text values are called text strings.
JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.
Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

### Declaring a variable
You can declare a variable and leave it undefined (has no value) by using 
>Ex:  
let carName;

and then you can assign it a value at a later stage.
>Ex:  
carName = "Audi"

you can also declare it when you declare it:
>Ex:  
let carName = "Audi"

It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

You can declare many variables in one statement.
Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:

### Arithmetic
As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and +  
You can also add strings, but strings will be concatenated.  
If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.

### $ Dollar sign & _underscore
Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names
Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names

### Functions
In JavaScript we use the function keyword for this followed by the name of the new function. Then the list of parameters in parentheses and then a block of expressions in curly braces. This is the body of the function.
>Ex:  
function show() {  
  console.log('Hello World');  
}  
console.log('before');  
show();  
console.log('after');  

You can call a function multiple times.  

You can alo provide *parameters*.  
>Ex:  
function show(name) {  
  console.log('Hello ', name);  
}  
show('Foo');  
show('Bar');  
show('Zorg');  

>The output will be:  
Hello Foo  
Hello Bar  
Hello Zorg  

In the function declaration we wrote that we are going to accept a single value and we want it to be assigned to the name variable. Then, we called the function and passed a value to it. In every call we passed a different value.

Inside the function the name variable holds the current value.


### Counter
In HTML5 **localStorage** is a term used for a flat key-value database inside the browser that can be accessed using JavaScript.  
This following example will be a counter that increments by one each time you refresh the page.  
>Ex:  
(div id="counter"_)(/div)
var n = localStorage.getItem('on_load_counter');   
if (n === null) {  
    n = 0;  
}  
n++;  
localStorage.setItem("on_load_counter", n);  
document.getElementById('counter').innerHTML = n;  

The example contains a single HTML div element that has a unique ID counter and a piece of JavaScript. The getItem method of the localStorage class will fetch the current value of the given key (in this case 'on_load_counter') and assign it to n.

The first time we load the page there won't be such key, and thus getItem will return a null value.

Next we check if the retreived value was indeed null and if it was, we initialize our counter to 0.

Then comes the incrementing of the counter n++;.

Then using the setItem method of localStorage we set the value of the 'on_load_counter' key to whatever is in n.

The final step is displaying the new number on the HTML page. document.getElementById('counter') provides access to HTML element with the id counter and then we set its content to be the value of n.

### Reset the counter

>Ex:  
(div id="counter")(/div)  
(button id="reset")Reset(/button)  
var n = localStorage.getItem('on_load_counter');  
if (n === null) {  
    n = 0;  
}  
n++;  
localStorage.setItem("on_load_counter", n);  
document.getElementById('counter').innerHTML = n;  
function reset_counter() {  
    localStorage.removeItem('on_load_counter');  
}  
document.getElementById('reset').addEventListener('click',   reset_counter);  

In this example we added another HTML element, a button with an ID of reset. In the JavaScript code we added a function called reset_counter that, if called, will use the removeItem method of localStorage to remove a key/value pair from the local storage.

In the last line we use document.getElementById('reset') again to identify the HTML button, and then we attach an event listener using the addEventListener method. This will make JavaScript execute the reset_counter function every time the given HTML element (the 'reset' button) is 'click'-ed.
