Git is your **local** repository  
GitHub is your **remote** repository

A repository os a collection of files that you've told Git to pay attention to:   
usually one project = 1 repository.

## Making a new repository
- make new repository 
- make sure SSH selected when pressing code
- copy and paste into Ubuntu making sure you know what path you are in.
- git clone (paste address from gitHub)
