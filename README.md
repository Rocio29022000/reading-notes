### Growth Mindset
What is growth mindset?  
**Growth** is expanding size of *something*. 
**Mind** is a person's ability to think and reason; the intellect.
As Chris mentioned yesterday; 
> "A flea can only jump as high as the jar its in " - Chris Seaman  

Growth mindset is a state of mind where you are seeking that expansion of your capabilities, where you, through practice, failure, perseverence and awareness, are able to develop your skillset.

#### Things to remember:
1. Prepare to put **effort** in: Nothing good comes without putting any effort in.  
2. Prepare to **fail**: Failures are great lessons. 
3. Prepare to **adapt**: Dont crumble if something unexpected happens, be ready to stay on your feet and do a quick turn.
