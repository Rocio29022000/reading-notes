### EXTRA: Learning git branching
[Git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

### Git Branching
* git commit: this is basically like taking a snapshot of your project
* git branch X: will create a new branch
* You have to switch the branch from main to the one desired if you want to commit the branch, you do this by:
* git checkout (name of branch)
* You can also create a branch and check it out by:
    * git checkout -b (name of branch)
Then we have to combine the work from two different branches together. This will allow us to branch off, develop a new feature and then combine it back in.  
* git merge: Creates a special commit that has two unique parents: "I want to include all the work from this parent over here and this one over here, and the set of all their parents."  
* git rebase: The second way of combining work between branches is rebasing. Rebasing essentially takes a set of commits, "copies" them, and plops them down somewhere else.

While this sounds confusing, the advantage of rebasing is that it can be used to make a nice linear sequence of commits. The commit log / history of the repository will be a lot cleaner if only rebasing is allowed.
