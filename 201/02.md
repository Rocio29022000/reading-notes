## Basics of HTML, CSS & JS
### Why does it matter?
This will provide a basic understanding of HTML, CSS & Javascript that will be essential to start building our projects. Without the basics we wouldnt know where to start! 

## Introduction to HTML
[Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)  
HTML is a language made up of elements, which give meaning to life! I mean... text...  
Its used to structure a document into logical sections.

### The Van-alogy
Lets say you are building a van. First you have to make up a list of the things you want to include, maybe you want to separate it into different elements: 
* Building work (nav, links, body, main... )
    - Floors
    - Electricity
    - Padding
* Furniture (headers, paragraphs, buttons tables...)
    - Bed
    - Kitchenette
    - Storage places
        - Shelves
        - Wardrobe
* Decorations (images, videos ...)
    - Plants
    - Pictures  

#### Right you get the point right? So HTML is where you are defining which of these elements you are going to have in your van.
