## Creating Hyperlinks
Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents or make apps available at a web address.  
A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an **(a)** element and using the *href* attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.
You can also make headers links by wrapping the h1 inside an a element.  
If you want to make an image a link use the **(a)** element to wrap the image file referenced with the (img) element.

### adding supporting information
 You can add another attribute such as a title, which contains additional information about the link.
