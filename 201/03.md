## Lists
### Ordered list
(ol): ordered list of items. (typically numbered list).  
This element also accepts global attributes such as:
- reversed: numbers will be numbered from high to low
- start: an integer to start counting from for the list items. For example, to start numbering elements from the letter d or the roman number iv use start = "4"
- type: sets the numbering type.
    - a for lowercase letters
    - A for uppercase letters
    - i for lowercase Roman numerals
    - I for uppercase Roman numerals
    - 1 for number (default)

You can nest uordered lists inside ordered lists. 

### Unordered list
(ul): unordered list of items. (Typically bulleted lists)
Includes global attributes such as:
- compact: This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered in a compact style. **DEPRACATED**
- type: circle, disc and square. (Triangle also used but not supported in all browsers)

### Questions
1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document? 

When the order of the list is not relevant. 

2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

using the attribute type: 

3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

You should use an ordered list when the order of the list elements matters, such as the steps in a recipe, if it doesnt then use unordered list.

4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

using the type attribute where you can set it to letters, roman numbers etc. you can also change the initia counter with the start attribute.


## The box model
### Block and inline boxes
The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to oter boxes on the page. boxes have an inner display type and an outer display type. In general, you can set various values for the display type using the display property, which can have various values.  

### Outer display type
If a box has an outer display type of block (
h1, p elements use block as their outer display by default ), then:

- The box will break onto a new line.
- The width and height properties are respected.
- Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.
- If width is not specified, the box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases, the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.


If a box has an outer display type of inline (like a, span, em and strong), then:
- The box will not break onto a new line.
- The width and height properties will not apply.
- Top and bottom padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.
- Left and right padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.


### inner display type
Boxes also have an inner display type, which dictates how elements inside that box are laid out.  
You can change the inner display type for example by setting display:flex.

### What is the CSS box model
The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes and defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and content — work together to create a box that you can see on a page. Inline boxes use just some of the behavior defined in the box model.

### Margins, padding and borders
#### Margin
The margin is an invisible space around your box. It pushes other elements away from the box. Margins can have positive or negative values. Setting a negative margin on one side of your box can cause it to overlap other things on the page. Whether you are using the standard or alternative box model, the margin is always added after the size of the visible box has been calculated.

#### Padding
The padding sits between the border and the content area and is used to push the content away from the border. Unlike margins, you cannot have a negative padding. Any background applied to your element will display behind the padding.

#### Borders
The border is drawn between the margin and the padding of a box. If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the width and height of the content box. If you are using the alternative box model then the size of the border makes the content box smaller as it takes up some of that available width and height of the element box.

### Questions
